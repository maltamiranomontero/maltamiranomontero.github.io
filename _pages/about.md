I’m a PhD Student in Statistical Science at UCL supervised by [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/) and [François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/). My research focuses on robust Bayesian inference and Gaussian Processes.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research engineer at Center of Mathematical Modeling - Universidad de Chile, using data science and stochastic modeling to different projects.
